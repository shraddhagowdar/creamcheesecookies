 CREAM CHEESE COOKIES - SHRADDHA.GOWDAR

INGREDIENTS -
1 3/4th cup/210 grams all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup / 113 grams room-temperature unsalted butter
4 ounces/130 grams cream cheese 
1 cup/200 grams of powdered sugar
2 teaspoons/10 ml vanilla extract
1 room temperature egg
2 large bowls
a spatula
a whisk
a sieve

RECIPE-
In one of the large bowls, sift in the flour, salt, and baking powder. After sifting mix a little and keep aside. In the other bowl,
put in the butter and whisk for a minute and half. The butter should turn fluffy and light. Now, add in the cream cheese and whisk again for 
two minutes. The butter and cream cheese should be well combined. Now add in the sugar and whisk until sugar dissolves. Add in the vanilla 
extract and mix for a minute. Scrape sides with a spatula. Put in the egg and mix until all ingredients are well combined. Now put in that 
flour you sift earlier and mix until you have a wet dough like consistency. Pop this dough into the fridge for 1.5 hours. 

Preheat the oven at 180*c for 2 mins. Remove the dough and take small balls and put them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. 
Make as many balls as you can and put them into the preheated oven for 10 minutes. After removing then out, leave them be for some time
until they cool off. If you do this, they will come out of the parchment paper very easily.

RESULTES-
The cookies should look light and fluffy. The colour is supposed to be white in colour. DO NOT OVER BAKE as they may burn this way. 
Sprinkle some powdered sugar to make them look nice

DONE !
